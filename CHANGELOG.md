# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Fixes

- Prevented K:04 split LED reconciliation from starting a status phase after the render timestamp, avoiding an `Instant` underflow panic during reconnect

## v0.1.9

Stable release for the standalone K:04 Series: K:04, K:04 Mini, and K:04 Micro. K:04 Qube profiles and all other keyboards remain on v0.1.8.

### Fixes

- Deferred host-BLE idle and disconnect power transitions while USB is the active output, fixing both K:04 halves freezing after the two-minute idle boundary on wired connections

### Verification

- Reproduced the v0.1.8 wired freeze on physical K:04 hardware, eliminated it with the host-power A/B build, and confirmed the final active-USB guard with a second hardware test

## v0.1.9-rc.2

Corrective release candidate for the standalone K:04 Series after review of `v0.1.9-rc.1`.

- CI now builds K:04, K:04 Mini, and K:04 Micro with the validated `production_v22` feature set
- Restored live left/right Ball DPI settings while retaining 600 CPI as the production default
- Applied USB `bcdDevice = 0x0109` to the actual device descriptor
- Enabled right-half split liveness recovery in non-diagnostic production builds
- Removed a non-portable atomic read-modify-write from the generic BLE path
- Queued each native i16 mouse delta once and moved HID chunking into the transport writers, preventing one extreme event from filling the report queue
- Restored the pre-v22 4/8 ms cadence and i8 event width for K:04 Qube halves
- Added regression coverage for the production workflow, USB BCD, split recovery, Qube isolation, live DPI, and extreme motion deltas

## v0.1.9-rc.1

Release candidate for the standalone K:04 Series: K:04, K:04 Mini, and K:04 Micro. K:04 Qube profiles and all other keyboards remain on v0.1.8.

The embedded Vial definition carries the full `0.1.9-rc.1` identity. VIA and USB fields that support only numeric versions advertise `0.1.9` / `0x0109`.

### Features

- Added the `production_v22` build profile for all six standalone K:04 Series half images, with diagnostic features excluded at compile time and release symbols stripped
- Added accumulated full-width `i16` motion transport from the right half so lowering the split report rate never discards trackball distance
- Added generation-aware split lifecycle state and recovery so the left half can reset, tear down stale resources, and reconnect to the still-running right half
- Added gated RTT instrumentation and regression helpers for split timing, HID queues, PMW3610 health, radio strength, USB state, and movement preservation; none are enabled in production images

### Improvements

- Set right-half motion reports to 15 ms, exactly two 7.5 ms split radio windows, while retaining 4 ms local trackball sampling
- Paced BLE HID mouse reports at 7.5 ms and merged queued relative motion with proportional vector-preserving chunking, retaining button ordering and total movement
- Configured the K:04 Series radio for +8 dBm and 1M PHY, and enabled the E73 REG1 DC/DC path with REG0 disabled
- Configured PMW3610 for 600 CPI, Smart Mode, software axis swapping, and verified register setup on K:04, Mini, and Micro
- Refreshed bonded-host connection parameters through an Apple-compatible 15 ms request followed by 7.5 ms when accepted, with a 15 ms/latency-zero fallback
- Preserved the v0.1.8 two-minute sleep timeout and host power policy

### Fixes

- Removed the persistent right-trackball latency caused by sending split movement faster than the BLE link could drain its notification queue
- Reduced weak-signal right-trackball microfreezes without clipping or losing accumulated motion
- Recovered PMW3610 from failed or implausible reads and added fallback reads after motion gaps
- Fixed split recovery after resetting the left half, including stale channel/resource cleanup and advertising/HCI race handling
- Cleared stale USB, POWER, and NVIC state left by the UF2 bootloader on the right half so disconnecting USB cannot leave it locked up
- Corrected VBUS/charging indication and made live split-searching state take priority over stale connected LED state

### Verification

- Passed all four motion pacing and movement-preservation tests, the RMK feature test matrix, and production builds for both halves of K:04, K:04 Mini, and K:04 Micro
- Validated all six UF2 images as nRF52840 firmware starting at `0x00026000`
- Physically validated K:04 right-trackball behavior at 20 cm and 60 cm; K:04 Mini and K:04 Micro still require model-specific hardware regression testing

## v0.1.8

### Features

- Added two-stage host BLE power saving to all seven supported Ergohaven standalone profiles—K:03, K:04, K:04 Mini, K:04 Micro, Imperial44, OP36, and Velvet—with low-duty host link parameters after two minutes, a fixed host disconnect after 30 minutes, and fast bonded wake that retains the first supported input event
- Advertised firmware-native Repeat/Again and Fork key-override capabilities to Entropy for all 14 supported Ergohaven standalone and Qube profiles

### Improvements

- Aligned the K:04 left-bracket key geometry with the surrounding row in Vial
- Expanded Vial Key Override capacity from 8 to 32 slots across every supported Ergohaven profile
- Updated the embedded firmware and package identity to v0.1.8 for all 14 supported Ergohaven standalone and Qube profiles

### Fixes

- Hardened bonded BLE wake through encryption, fast reconnect, local HID suspend, safe split-radio scheduling, stale-peer recovery, and fail-closed recovery from stalled HID notifications
- Released temporary wake-input observers immediately after reconnect so their queues cannot block a key release and leave the last key repeating
- Preserved queued input across sleeping reconnects and restored bonded reconnect and macro layer actions
- Prevented K:04 from reporting a false full-battery state while charging

## v0.1.8-rc.5

### Improvements

- Advertised firmware-native Repeat/Again support so Entropy can expose it independently from QMK Alt Repeat slots

### Verification

- Kept every production Ergohaven profile at 32 Morse / Tap Dance entries

## v0.1.8-rc.4

### Features

- Added two-stage host BLE power saving for standalone K:04, K:04 Mini, and K:04 Micro: low-duty connection parameters after two minutes, then a configurable full disconnect after 10 minutes to 5 hours
- Preserved the first keyboard, encoder, trackball, or touchpad event while reconnecting after idle sleep

### Fixes

- Applied host disconnect timeout changes immediately and migrated existing v0.1.7 settings to the new 30-minute default
- Kept wake-key press and release reports ordered while a sleeping bonded host reconnects, without blocking later keyboard input

## v0.1.7

### Features

- Added firmware-native Universal Symbols and Russian letters to dynamic Combo and Tap Dance actions
- Added persistent per-combo activation layers configurable from Entropy
- Advertised exact firmware update package identities for all 14 supported Ergohaven keyboard and Qube profiles

### Fixes

- Suspended K:04 trackball and touchpad modules during automatic sleep while preserving their selected type and settings after wake
- Stabilized repeated macro saves, split BLE traffic, pointing-mode changes, and K:04 thumb-cluster geometry

### Removed

- Removed RMK firmware and release builds for the standalone Trackball Mini v3.0, Mini v3.1, and Royale devices

## v0.1.5-rc.1

### Features

- Added modular firmware-native Universal Symbols for EN/RU punctuation, autonomous layout controls, PC/macOS mappings, and optional Entropy Layout Sync
- Advertised Universal Symbols support through the Ergohaven native key-action capability protocol and enabled it for every bundled Ergohaven keyboard profile
- Added firmware-native Russian `х`, `б`, `ю`, and `ъ` actions that behave like regular shifted letter keys while the Russian layout is active

## v0.1.4

### Features

- Added unified Velvet UI firmware for Standalone and Qube, with the right half as the Standalone central and optional PMW3610 trackball support
- Added persistent Velvet trackball enable and Mouse auto-layer timeout controls for Entropy
- Added left/right battery telemetry, live Qube display data, and consistent factory layouts across the unified Ergohaven profiles
- Embedded the Ergohaven firmware version `0.1.4` in every released keyboard definition and exposed it through VIA `id_firmware_version`

### Fixes

- Fixed Velvet startup and split-runtime panics caused by exhausted settings and layer subscribers
- Fixed PMW3610 report starvation, idle jitter, auto-layer timeouts, and stale-motion accumulation
- Fixed split BLE framing, link cadence, HCI command serialization, reconnect synchronization, and wake responsiveness
- Restored RP2040/Pico split compatibility by avoiding unsupported ARMv6-M atomic read-modify-write operations
- Fixed Qube display redraws blocking pointer reports; Shift and Command indicators now update atomically without cursor freezes
- Fixed K:04 encoder detents and USB layer indication, classic keyboard defaults, and live split status reporting

## v0.1.3

### Features

- Added complete K:04 Series firmware for K:04, Mini, and Micro in standalone and Qube configurations
- Added left/right battery telemetry and Qube live display data across the complete K:04 Series
- Added module-aware pointing settings, configurable encoder steps, and factory-enabled touchpad acceleration and gestures for the K:04 Series
- Embedded the Ergohaven manufacturer and firmware version `0.1.3` in the released K:04 and trackball definitions and exposed the same version through VIA `id_firmware_version`

### Fixes

- Fixed split wake latency after idle while retaining the power-saving connection interval
- Fixed excessive idle polling for trackball and touchpad modules
- Fixed BLE Vial report framing, host-session responsiveness, discovery compatibility, and split battery updates
- Fixed K:04 settings persistence, Layer LED writes, touch gestures, and Qube pointing runtime parity
